Advanced Routing
----------------

* Use a scope() to make api endpoints.
* Use resources() to add Tickets and nested Emails
* Show that parameters are not being passed, fix that.
* Add a finder for finding emails by ticket.
* Update view and delete endpoints.

Middleware
----------

* Build a simple rate limit middleware for our API.
* Use bake to get started.
* Use cache for storing counter.
* Simple time + ip based implementation. Later on we'll make it better.
* `curl http://localhost:8765/ -v 2>&1 | grep X-Rate-Limit` check rate limit in curl.
